# ABTestingwithPython

A/B testing is a fundamental technique in data analysis that involves comparing two variants to determine which one performs better on a specific performance indicator. It's especially prevalent in web analytics, marketing, product design, and user experience research. The goal is to make data-driven decisions rather than relying on assumptions.
